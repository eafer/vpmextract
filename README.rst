This is a small (and probably not entirely correct) tool to extract audio from
some versions of Garmin vpm (Voice Processing Module) files. I wrote it because
I was struggling to get any of the old tools for this purpose to run on Linux,
and the format was so simple that it wasn't worth the trouble. So I'll leave it
here and maybe it will help someone else.

To build: as long as you have ``gcc`` and ``make`` installed, you can just run
``make``. The code is intended to be portable, but I haven't tested that.
